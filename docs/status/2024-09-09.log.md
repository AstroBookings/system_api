# Session Update: 2024-09-09

## Development Steps

1. `system-api/src/api/authentication/authentication.module.ts`: Updated module structure
   - Merged `AuthenticationServicesModule` into `AuthenticationModule`
   - Removed separate `authentication-services.module.ts` file
   - Consolidated imports, providers, and exports

## Key Decisions

- Decided to flatten the authentication module structure for simplicity
- Kept the `services` folder intact to maintain separation of concerns

## Next Steps

1. Update imports in other files that were referencing `AuthenticationServicesModule`
   - Review all files in the `authentication` folder and its subfolders
   - Check for any imports in other modules that might be affected
2. Review and update tests affected by the module restructuring
   - Focus on `authentication.module.spec.ts` if it exists
   - Check other test files that might be importing `AuthenticationServicesModule`
3. Verify application builds and runs correctly after changes
   - Run the build process and address any compilation errors
   - Start the application and test authentication-related functionality
4. Consider implementing environment-based configuration for JWT secret
   - Replace hardcoded `secret` with an environment variable
   - Update documentation to reflect this change
5. Review and potentially refactor other modules following the same pattern
   - Look for other modules that might benefit from a similar restructuring

Progress: Completed the restructuring of the Authentication module. Next session will focus on updating affected imports, tests, and ensuring the application runs correctly with the new structure.

```bash
git add ./src/api/authentication/authentication.module.ts
git rm ./src/api/authentication/services/authentication-services.module.ts

git commit -m "Refactor Authentication module structure

- Merged AuthenticationServicesModule into AuthenticationModule
- Removed authentication-services.module.ts
- Updated imports and providers in authentication.module.ts
- Added session log for 2023-04-15

This change simplifies the module structure while maintaining separation of concerns."
```

## Prompt

- Refactor to use paths from @tsconfig.json
- Make JWT config an immutable constant and move it to a proper file
- Use the @.cursorrules guidelines

### Development Steps

1. `system-api/src/core/config/jwt.config.ts`: Created new file for JWT configuration

   - Defined JWT_CONFIG constant with secret and sign options
   - Added JSDoc documentation for the constant

2. `system-api/src/api/authentication/authentication.module.ts`: Refactored imports and configuration
   - Updated imports to use path aliases from tsconfig.json
   - Replaced inline JWT configuration with imported JWT_CONFIG
   - Reorganized imports for better readability

### Key Decisions

- Moved JWT configuration to a separate file for better organization and maintainability
- Used path aliases to improve code readability and make imports more consistent
- Made JWT configuration constant immutable using 'as const' to prevent accidental modifications

### Next Steps

1. Implement environment-based configuration for JWT secret and other sensitive data
   - Create a configuration service to manage environment-specific settings
   - Update JWT_CONFIG to use values from the configuration service
2. Review and refactor other modules to use path aliases consistently
   - Identify modules that aren't using path aliases
   - Update imports in these modules to use the appropriate aliases
3. Implement unit tests for the AuthenticationModule
   - Create test files for AuthenticationService, HashService, and TokenService
   - Write tests covering the main functionality of each service

Progress: Completed initial refactoring of the AuthenticationModule and JWT configuration. Next session will focus on implementing environment-based configuration and improving test coverage.
