# Session Update: 2024-09-10

## Prompt

- Resolve linter errors in ArrangeController
- Update imports to use path aliases from tsconfig.json
- Ensure consistency in naming and file structure

## Development Steps

1. `system-api/src/api/authentication/arrange/arrange.controller.ts`: Updated imports and resolved linter errors

   - Fixed import paths using tsconfig.json aliases
   - Corrected decorator usage for NestJS controllers and methods
   - Ensured proper typing for controller methods

2. `system-api/src/api/authentication/authentication.module.ts`: Updated imports

   - Changed import path for ArrangeController to use the new location

3. `system-api/src/api/authentication/models/user.type.ts`: Verified file exists and exports User type

   - Ensured proper export of User type for use in ArrangeController

4. `system-api/src/api/authentication/services/authentication.service.ts`: Verified file exists and exports AuthenticationService
   - Ensured proper export of AuthenticationService for use in ArrangeController

## Key Decisions

- Decided to keep the ArrangeController name instead of reverting to AdminController for consistency with recent changes
- Chose to use path aliases from tsconfig.json for improved code organization and readability

## Next Steps

1. Update `system-api/test/authentication.e2e.spec.ts` to reflect changes in ArrangeController

   - Adjust test cases to use the correct endpoint ('/api/authentication/arrange')
   - Ensure all imports are using the correct path aliases

2. Review and update `system-api/src/api/authentication/authentication.yml` if it exists

   - Update any references to the controller's route or methods

3. Implement proper error handling in ArrangeController

   - Add try-catch blocks for database operations
   - Use NestJS built-in exception filters for consistent error responses

4. Enhance unit tests for ArrangeController
   - Add more test cases to cover edge cases and error scenarios
   - Ensure full coverage of all controller methods

Progress: Resolved linter errors in ArrangeController and updated imports. Next session will focus on updating e2e tests, improving error handling, and enhancing unit tests for the controller.

## Prompt

Refactor the AdminService to improve code organization and consistency.

### Development Steps

1. `system-api/src/api/admin/admin.service.ts`: Refactored AdminService
   - Introduced readonly private fields for collection names
   - Created private methods for each database operation (clear, create, seed) for each collection
   - Renamed 'entry_log' to 'log_entries' for consistency
   - Updated seed data to match the original implementation

### Key Decisions

- Chose to use private methods for each database operation to improve modularity and maintainability
- Renamed 'entry_log' to 'log_entries' for better naming consistency across the application

### Next Steps

1. Update the AdminController to use the refactored AdminService
2. Ensure all references to 'entry_log' are updated to 'log_entries' throughout the application
3. Write unit tests for the refactored AdminService
