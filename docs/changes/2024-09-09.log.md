# Session Update: 2024-09-09

## Development Steps

1. `system-api/src/api/authentication/authentication.module.ts`: Updated module structure
   - Merged `AuthenticationServicesModule` into `AuthenticationModule`
   - Removed separate `authentication-services.module.ts` file
   - Consolidated imports, providers, and exports

## Key Decisions

- Decided to flatten the authentication module structure for simplicity
- Kept the `services` folder intact to maintain separation of concerns

## Next Steps

1. Update imports in other files that were referencing `AuthenticationServicesModule`
   - Review all files in the `authentication` folder and its subfolders
   - Check for any imports in other modules that might be affected
2. Review and update tests affected by the module restructuring
   - Focus on `authentication.module.spec.ts` if it exists
   - Check other test files that might be importing `AuthenticationServicesModule`
3. Verify application builds and runs correctly after changes
   - Run the build process and address any compilation errors
   - Start the application and test authentication-related functionality
4. Consider implementing environment-based configuration for JWT secret
   - Replace hardcoded `secret` with an environment variable
   - Update documentation to reflect this change
5. Review and potentially refactor other modules following the same pattern
   - Look for other modules that might benefit from a similar restructuring

Progress: Completed the restructuring of the Authentication module. Next session will focus on updating affected imports, tests, and ensuring the application runs correctly with the new structure.

```bash
git add ./src/api/authentication/authentication.module.ts
git rm ./src/api/authentication/services/authentication-services.module.ts

git commit -m "Refactor Authentication module structure

- Merged AuthenticationServicesModule into AuthenticationModule
- Removed authentication-services.module.ts
- Updated imports and providers in authentication.module.ts
- Added session log for 2023-04-15

This change simplifies the module structure while maintaining separation of concerns."
```

## Prompt

- Refactor to use paths from @tsconfig.json
- Make JWT config an immutable constant and move it to a proper file
- Use the @.cursorrules guidelines

### Development Steps

1. `system-api/src/core/config/jwt.config.ts`: Created new file for JWT configuration

   - Defined JWT_CONFIG constant with secret and sign options
   - Added JSDoc documentation for the constant

2. `system-api/src/api/authentication/authentication.module.ts`: Refactored imports and configuration
   - Updated imports to use path aliases from tsconfig.json
   - Replaced inline JWT configuration with imported JWT_CONFIG
   - Reorganized imports for better readability

### Key Decisions

- Moved JWT configuration to a separate file for better organization and maintainability
- Used path aliases to improve code readability and make imports more consistent
- Made JWT configuration constant immutable using 'as const' to prevent accidental modifications

### Next Steps

1. Implement environment-based configuration for JWT secret and other sensitive data
   - Create a configuration service to manage environment-specific settings
   - Update JWT_CONFIG to use values from the configuration service
2. Review and refactor other modules to use path aliases consistently
   - Identify modules that aren't using path aliases
   - Update imports in these modules to use the appropriate aliases
3. Implement unit tests for the AuthenticationModule
   - Create test files for AuthenticationService, HashService, and TokenService
   - Write tests covering the main functionality of each service

Progress: Completed initial refactoring of the AuthenticationModule and JWT configuration. Next session will focus on implementing environment-based configuration and improving test coverage.

## Prompt

- Rename AdminController to ArrangeController and update related files

### Development Steps

1. `system-api/src/api/authentication/arrange/arrange.controller.ts`: Renamed AdminController to ArrangeController
   - Updated class name and controller route
   - Updated imports to use path aliases
2. `system-api/test/authentication.e2e.spec.ts`: Updated e2e tests to use new ArrangeController endpoint
   - Changed all references from 'admin' to 'arrange' in API calls
3. `system-api/src/api/authentication/arrange/arrange.controller.spec.ts`: Created new spec file for ArrangeController
   - Implemented unit tests for all methods in ArrangeController
   - Used mock AuthenticationService for testing

### Key Decisions

- Chose to rename 'admin' to 'arrange' to better reflect the arranging nature of the controller
- Kept the existing functionality of the controller while updating its name and location

### Next Steps

1. Update authentication module to use the new ArrangeController
2. Ensure all imports across the project are updated to reflect the new file structure
3. Consider adding more comprehensive error handling in the ArrangeController

Progress: Completed renaming of AdminController to ArrangeController and updated related tests. Next session will focus on updating the authentication module and ensuring all imports are correct throughout the project.

```bash
git commit -a -m "Rename AdminController to ArrangeController

- Renamed AdminController to ArrangeController in arrange.controller.ts
- Updated e2e tests in authentication.e2e.spec.ts to use new AuxController endpoint
- Created new spec file arrange.controller.spec.ts for ArrangeController
- Updated imports to use path aliases
- Added session log for 2024-09-09

This change improves the naming convention and better reflects the arranging nature of the controller."
